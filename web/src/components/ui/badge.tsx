/**
 * Badge — hand-reworked at the V4 tokens (§1.10, D-200).
 *
 * This file arrived from the shadcn registry and is no longer upstream's: it is formatted by
 * Prettier like the rest of `src/`, and a future `shadcn add` would overwrite the work below
 * rather than merge with it. It is the other component already in use (D-192).
 *
 * `rounded-4xl` -> `rounded-pill`. DESIGN.md §6 reserves the pill shape for chips and
 *   badges, and `rounded-4xl` was a radius multiplier large enough to look like one by
 *   accident rather than a shape that says what it is.
 * `transition-all` -> the properties that change, at `--duration-fast`.
 *
 * The 12px glyph is the one deliberate exception to the 16/20/24 icon scale (§1.9). A badge
 * is 20px tall; a 16px icon inside it leaves 2px of air and reads as a button. Raising the
 * badge instead would move four call sites for no gain.
