# Decision Log

Every non-obvious choice, why it was made, and **how to undo it**. Victor reviews the site
and reverses things; this file exists so reversing is a lookup, not an archaeology dig.

Newest first. When a decision is reversed, do not delete the entry — move it to
[Reversed](#reversed) with a note. The history of what was tried and rejected is the
useful part.

### D-014 · Labs cut to one entry, promoted to a project

**Decision.** Four of the five Physics 4BL labs (optics, RLC, sound, resistor/LED) are now
`public: false`. The solenoid bit reader moved to `01_engineering/projects/` as a hardware
project. The `/labs` route and its nav entry are gone.

**Why.** Victor's read was right. Those four are *assigned coursework* — every student in the
course measures an I-V curve and the speed of sound. They demonstrate compliance, not
capability, and on a portfolio they dilute the work that does differentiate. The solenoid lab
is categorically different: a self-directed macro-scale hard-disk-reader analog, 387-turn
coil, op-amp gain staging, calibration matrix, 100% decode accuracy. That is a build, and it
belongs next to the other builds rather than filed under coursework.

A `/labs` index holding one item also reads as an abandoned section, which is worse than no
section.

**How to reverse.** Flip `public: true` on the four lab files, restore `web/src/app/labs/`
from git history (`git show 2699a2a:web/src/app/labs/page.tsx`), and re-add the nav entry in
`site-header.tsx`. The lab entries were never deleted from the vault, so nothing is lost.

**Note.** The four labs stay in the vault deliberately — they are real academic history and
useful context for any AI reading the vault. Only their *publication* changed.

### D-013 · Projects carry a hero image, with a generated placeholder fallback

**Decision.** `image` is an optional project frontmatter field. When absent, `ProjectFigure`
renders a deterministic SVG placeholder derived from the project slug rather than a grey box.

**Why.** Victor has no photography yet but will. A placeholder that is on-palette and varies
per project keeps the grid looking designed in the meantime, and dropping a real file in later
is a one-line frontmatter change with no component edit.

**How to reverse.** Delete the `image` field and render nothing; the grid falls back to the
text-only cards from commit `2699a2a`.

### D-012 · The card sweep loops while hovered

**Decision.** `card-scan`'s highlight sweep repeats on a 2.4s cycle (sweep, then pause)
instead of firing once.

**Why.** Two reasons, one of them a bug fix. The one-shot version ended with the highlight
*parked over the card*: the animation had no fill mode, so on completion the transform
reverted to its base value and left a bright static band sitting on the left of every hovered
card. The keyframes also only travelled to 120% of the bar's own width — about 54% of the
card — so it never actually exited. Base transform now rests off-card and the travel is
260%. Looping is also the thematically right behaviour: a scope refreshes continuously.

**How to reverse.** Drop `infinite` from the animation shorthand in `globals.css` and keep
the corrected keyframes and base transform — those are the bug fix and should not be reverted
independently.

### D-011 · Breadth content is its own vault entity, not a projection of the training logs

**Decision.** `context/03_craft_and_creative/pursuits/` holds the portfolio framing of dragon
boat, fabrication, and baking. The public build never reads `benchmarks_and_logs.md` or
`culinary_formulas.md`.

**Why.** Those files hold bodyweight, protein and creatine targets, and a lower-back rehab
protocol. Victor is comfortable storing health data in the cloud; that is not the same as
publishing it to recruiters. A separate entity means the risk is structurally absent rather
than mitigated by an allowlist that someone has to maintain correctly forever.

**How to reverse.** Not recommended. If the breadth section is cut entirely, delete the
`pursuits/` directory, `pursuitSchema`, `loadPursuits`, `publicPursuits`, and the section in
`page.tsx`.

### D-010 · Collaborator names are never published; group size is

**Decision.** `collaborators` is excluded from the public lab projection. The site shows
"N-person group lab" instead.

**Why.** Victor asked for the names to come off. Beyond that, they are private individuals
who did not agree to appear on a public portfolio. Group size stays because silently
presenting group work as solo misrepresents it to exactly the audience the site is for.

**How to reverse.** Add `collaborators` back to `PublicLab`, `toPublicLab`, and
`PUBLIC_LAB_KEYS`, and delete the privacy test in `public.test.ts`. The names were never
removed from frontmatter.

### D-009 · `## Notes` sections are stripped from every public body

**Decision.** `stripInternalSections()` removes the vault's `## Notes` convention from
project, experience, and lab bodies before rendering.

**Why.** Those sections hold relative links into `99_archive` and notes-to-self about
frontmatter. Bodies render verbatim on public pages, so they were being published. Handling
it at the projection layer rather than per-file means the next entry added is covered without
anyone remembering to.

**How to reverse.** Delete the call sites; the function is pure and independently tested.

### D-008 · Palette replaced with Victor's six swatches

**Decision.** Gold/warm-near-black is gone. Teal `#09A1A1` primary, rose `#D396A6`
secondary, peach `#F6C992` as the single warm note, on grounds derived from `#30525C`.

**Why.** Victor supplied the palette and said the gold and the flat background were not to
taste. Only `#30525C` was dark enough to build grounds from, so the page and card colours are
that hue driven down in lightness — this keeps surfaces the same temperature as the accents
instead of fighting them.

**Open question.** The supplied image labels a *pink* swatch `#30525C`, which is a dark
slate teal. The hex codes were treated as authoritative. If the pink was intended, this
decision needs revisiting.

**How to reverse.** `git show a81dee8:web/src/app/globals.css` has the gold palette intact.

### D-007 · The background is not a flat fill

**Decision.** `<html>` paints the base colour; `body::before` layers three drifting radial
pools and `body::after` adds SVG-noise grain.

**Why.** Victor asked for the solid background to go. The grain is not decoration — wide
radial fills band visibly on 8-bit displays, and noise dithers them out.

**Constraint this creates.** `body` must stay background-less. Giving it an opaque background
buries both layers, and the symptom (a flat page) looks like the CSS simply did not apply.

**How to reverse.** Delete the two pseudo-element rules and put `bg-background` back on
`body` in `layout.tsx`.

### D-006 · Auth is self-hosted WebAuthn, not Clerk

**Decision.** `@clerk/nextjs` removed; `@simplewebauthn/server` + `/browser` in.

**Why.** Clerk gates passkeys to its Pro tier at $20-25/mo — recurring, and far outside the
$0 (max $5) budget. There is exactly one user forever, which makes Clerk's real job
(multi-tenant identity, org management, arbitrary sign-up flows) pure overhead.

**How to reverse.** Reinstall `@clerk/nextjs` and accept the subscription, or use Clerk's
free-tier email-code sign-in and give up passkeys.

### D-005 · Motion lives in two custom utilities, not repeated class chains

**Decision.** `card-scan` and `link-wipe` are `@utility` blocks in `globals.css`.

**Why.** The same hover treatment appears on five surfaces. As a Tailwind chain it was ~90
characters repeated per element, and changing the feel meant editing every one. Both collapse
under `prefers-reduced-motion` in one place.

**How to reverse.** Inline the CSS at each call site.

### D-004 · `SiteHeader` is a Client Component

**Decision.** It uses `usePathname` for the active-route indicator.

**Why.** The alternative is threading the pathname from every page. It receives only a name
string, so the RSC payload cost is negligible.

**How to reverse.** Drop the indicator and the `"use client"` directive.

### D-003 · Public projections name every field explicitly

Never spread-and-delete. A field added to the vault tomorrow is private by default, and
reaching a public page requires a deliberate edit plus a test update. **Do not "simplify"
this into a spread.** Two real leaks were caught by scanning built output, not by the type
system.

### D-002 · Fonts are self-hosted

`next/font/google` fetches at build time; a meaningful chunk of this project is written in a
car and on a plane. Files came from `@fontsource`.

### D-001 · Monorepo — `web/` inside the vault repo

Vault writes trigger public rebuilds, and other projects can clone and read `context/`
directly, which Victor asked for.
