# Decision Log

Every non-obvious choice, why it was made, and **how to undo it**. Victor reviews the site
and reverses things; this file exists so reversing is a lookup, not an archaeology dig.

Newest first. When a decision is reversed, do not delete the entry — move it to
[Reversed](#reversed) with a note. The history of what was tried and rejected is the
useful part.

## 2026-08-24 · V2 close-out decisions

### D-072 · A local browser is the only MCP server

**Decision.** `.mcp.json` runs `@playwright/mcp` locally, isolated, at a 1280×900 viewport.
Nothing else is configured.

**Why.** Two of the remaining tasks — resume design and the mobile layout pass — are purely
visual, and until now the site has only ever been verified by grepping built HTML. That caught
fabricated content and privacy leaks, but it cannot answer "does this look right", which is the
actual question for both jobs.

Local matters more than the capability. The repo is private and holds health data; a browser
driven on Victor's own machine sends nothing anywhere. The alternatives considered — Sentry,
Semgrep, Datadog, a Neon MCP — all ship code, telemetry or query results to a third party, and
three of them imply paid tiers against a $0 budget. Sentry alone remains defensible later, and
would need scrubbing rules before it touches the private site.

`--isolated` so no browser profile persists between runs, and no cookie or session from ordinary
browsing is reachable from an automated one.

**How to reverse.** Delete `.mcp.json`. Verification returns to inspecting built output.

### D-071 · The whole log, health included, may be sent to the model

**Decision.** The AI summary sends everything: sprint goals and all six log categories,
athletics and bodyweight among them. Asked directly, Victor chose this over excluding health.

**Why.** It is his data and his call, and a summary that silently omits training is a summary of
a fraction of his day.

**This does not loosen the publication rule, which is unchanged and absolute.** Health data must
never reach a public page. The two are different acts: one sends data to an API under Victor's
own key for a private page only he can see; the other bakes it into a world-readable static
bundle. A future agent reading "everything goes to Google" as licence to publish bodyweight
would be misreading this entry.

Practical consequences worth stating: prompts leave the machine, so anything sent is subject to
Google's retention, and the summary is cached — meaning health-derived text sits in the Next
cache alongside everything else.

**How to reverse.** Filter by category in `AiSummary` before building the prompt. The
`summarise()` output is already per-category, so the filter is one predicate.

### D-070 · Feature 6 gets all four capabilities, summaries first

**Decision.** Read-only summaries, draft-sprint-goals behind an approval diff, resume tailoring,
and semantic search — all four, built in that order, after the public-site work.

**Why.** Victor picked the public site as the priority for the pre-term window: the resume is
what gets him interviews and fall recruiting is imminent, whereas feature 6 is for him alone and
fits the 4h/week he will have during term.

On cost, he judged the $10 sufficient — semantic search will be used rarely and Flash is cheap.
That is a real constraint rather than a guess, so embeddings must be cached and re-embedding
must be incremental, not a full pass on every vault edit.

Draft-sprint-goals is what forces the approval-gated write UI to exist. That gate is
non-negotiable: nothing writes to the vault on a model's say-so.

**How to reverse.** Build only the summaries and drop the rest; nothing else depends on them.

---

## 2026-08-24 · Review of external changes

### D-069 · Nothing on the public site may be inferred, only recorded

**Decision.** Project entries state what Victor has told us and nothing else. Where detail is
missing the file says so under a "Still to write up" heading and carries `draft: true`, which
keeps it on the portfolio but off every resume.

**Why.** The water bottle scale entry was rewritten with invented specifics — an ESP32 (Victor
said Arduino Uno), an HX711 amplifier, "±2g accuracy", a 5-second-window state machine and MQTT
streaming — and marked `draft: false` with `resume_variants: [swe, robotics]`. All of it reached
the built portfolio and two resume pages. Fabricated technical detail on a hiring-facing
document is the worst failure this project can produce: it is discovered in an interview, by
someone asking a follow-up question.

The previous placeholder had listed exactly what needed filling in. Those prompts became the
fabrication — "one measured number: accuracy in millilitres" became "±2g accuracy".

**How to reverse.** Fill the entry in with real detail from Victor, then set `draft: false` and
add resume variants. Do not do it the other way round.

### D-068 · `experience[0]` is "most recent", never "now"

**Decision.** The homepage spotlight is headed "Most recent" and prints the entry's real
`dateEnd`.

**Why.** It was headed "What I'm working on now" with a hard-coded `— Present`. Dimaag.ai's
vault entry says `date_end: 2026-08`, so the public site told every hiring manager that a
finished internship was ongoing — a claim about employment produced by a string literal and an
array index.

The "what I'm working on now" section Victor actually asked for is about current *work* —
2ndMind, coursework — and is still unbuilt. Reusing the experience list for it was not the same
feature.

**How to reverse.** Only with a field that says a role is current, and only driven by data.

### D-067 · The AI summary is cached and reads the live log

**Decision.** `generateDailySummary` wraps the model call in `unstable_cache` (6h TTL, tag
`ai-summary`) keyed on the prompt, and the dashboard feeds it today's `log_entries` rows plus
the sprint goals section — not `logbook_archive.md`.

**Why.** Two defects. The call sat uncached on `/private`, which is `force-dynamic` and the page
Victor opens most, so every load re-summarised an unchanged day against a $10 lifetime credit
budget. And it summarised the *retired* free-text logbook — the thing feature 2 replaced and
Victor asked to rework or delete — so it described a system he stopped using while ignoring
everything he has written since.

Keying the cache on the prompt rather than on time means a real change in goals or log produces
a new summary immediately; only repetition is free.

**How to reverse.** Call `callModel` directly and pass whatever context is wanted.

### D-066 · `app/error.tsx` shows a digest, not a message

**Decision.** The message is rendered only in development; production shows the digest.

**Why.** This boundary sits at the root of `app/`, so it covers the public portfolio. Next
redacts server-thrown messages in production, but anything thrown in a client component arrives
verbatim — and this page is reachable by anyone. A digest locates the real trace in the Vercel
logs and tells a passer-by nothing.

It is deliberately **not** renamed to `global-error.tsx`. That file replaces the root layout,
must render its own `<html>`/`<body>`, and fires only for errors thrown in the layout itself.
Renaming would trade the boundary that catches nearly everything for the one that catches the
rarest case. Both may exist; one may not become the other.

**How to reverse.** Render `error.message` unconditionally, and accept that public visitors see
internal strings.

### D-065 · Structure is parsed, text is edited by offset

**Decision.** `frontmatter.ts` locates sections and bullets with an mdast parse, then edits the
located byte range as text rather than re-printing the tree.

**Why.** This closes a real corruption bug: a `##` inside a fenced code block used to terminate
a section, so replacing an earlier section left a dangling fence and a fake heading behind. A
regex cannot tell that a line is inside a fence. Measured on the old implementation before the
change, so the benefit is established rather than assumed.

Editing by offset, not re-printing, because `mdast` round-tripping normalises whitespace, list
markers and emphasis characters — rewriting parts of a file nobody touched and making every
diff unreadable.

Note what this does *not* do: `setLabelledBullet`, `getLabelledBullet` and `setFrontmatterField`
still use the same regexes as before, now applied inside a narrowed range. The `m`-flag and
CRLF traps therefore still apply, which is why the module header still documents them.

**How to reverse.** The pre-AST implementation is at commit `4fe26eb`. Reverting reintroduces
the code-fence bug.

### D-064 · No client runtime in the root layout without a caller

**Decision.** `<Toaster />` removed from `app/layout.tsx`.

**Why.** It was mounted globally while nothing in the codebase calls `toast()`. That shipped a
client component — and its hydration cost — to every page including the statically generated
public portfolio, for zero functionality. The public site's whole value is arriving as finished
HTML.

**How to reverse.** Add it back at the same time as the first `toast()` call, and preferably in
the private layout rather than the root one.

---

## 2026-08-22 · Athletics depth (feature 5)

### D-063 · The `db:migrate` script loads `.env.local` itself

**Decision.** `node --env-file-if-exists=.env.local ./node_modules/drizzle-kit/bin.cjs migrate`.

**Why.** `drizzle-kit` does not read `.env.local` the way Next does, so `npm run db:migrate`
failed with an empty `url` even with the variable sitting right there in the file. Every
migration therefore needed a remembered incantation, which is exactly the kind of friction
that ends with migrations not being run.

**How to reverse.** Put `"drizzle-kit migrate"` back and set `DATABASE_URL` in the shell first.

### D-062 · The Los Angeles offset is computed, not hard-coded

**Decision.** `zoneOffsetMinutes(now, timeZone)` in `lib/tasks/queries.ts`, replacing the
`const LA_OFFSET_MINUTES = 420` repeated in three pages.

**Why.** 420 is only correct while Los Angeles is on daylight time. It would have gone wrong
on **2026-11-01**, during term — and quietly: "today" would have begun at 11pm the night
before, filing every late-evening task and log entry under tomorrow for the whole of winter.
The new function formats the instant in the zone and reads it back as UTC, which is the only
way to get a real offset without shipping a timezone database.

**How to reverse.** Pass a literal offset to `dayBounds` again. Do not — the constant is wrong
for five months of the year.

### D-061 · Charts are server-rendered SVG, not `recharts`

**Decision.** `components/site/chart.tsx` draws `TrendChart` and `BarChart` by hand. `recharts`
stays unused in `package.json`.

**Why.** These are one `<polyline>` each. Using the library would add a client boundary and a
charting runtime to a page that currently arrives as finished HTML, turning a streamed render
into one that waits for hydration — the exact regression D-045 was written to prevent.

**How to reverse.** `recharts` is already installed; replace the two components. Accept that
the athletics page then ships JavaScript to draw its charts.

### D-060 · Warmup sets count toward volume but never toward a record

**Decision.** `weeklyVolume` deliberately does not apply `isWorkingSet`; `strengthRecords`,
`ergRecords` and `flagSpm` all do.

**Why.** Victor was asked directly and said volume should include warmups — they are load the
body absorbed. A record set by a warmup, though, is not a record. This was V1 finding F10,
where the two rules were inconsistent by accident rather than on purpose; they are now
inconsistent on purpose, which is different, and the test says so.

**How to reverse.** Add `if (!isWorkingSet(effort)) continue;` to `weeklyVolume`.

### D-059 · The rehab checklist is its own table, not `tasks`

**Decision.** `rehab_completions`, keyed `(completed_on, slug)`.

**Why.** D-037 merged everything actionable into `tasks` so there would be one list to read.
Four rehab items every day is ~1,400 rows a year, which would bury the thing D-037 was
protecting. A daily-recurring checklist is a different shape from a to-do: it is never "done",
only "done today".

**How to reverse.** Insert four `tasks` rows a day with `source: "rehab"` and delete this
table. Expect the task list to become unreadable within a fortnight.

### D-058 · Bodyweight is a table, and it is health data

**Decision.** `bodyweight_entries`, one row per day, `date` rather than `timestamp`.

**Why.** It is the second input to every weight-adjusted split on the site, so "the weight
closest to this piece" has to be an indexed lookup rather than a scan through JSONB. `date`
because a weigh-in belongs to a morning, not an instant — storing days as timestamps is what
forces the noon-UTC trick used elsewhere here, and it breaks the first time Victor travels.

One reading per day, upserted: weighing twice in a morning is normal, and two rows would put
two contradictory points on one day of the chart.

**Privacy.** This is the field Victor named as never publishable. No public route imports the
schema, and the built client chunks were scanned — the only hits were the form's own UI copy.

**How to reverse.** Drop the table and delete `adjusted.ts`; the site falls back to raw splits.

### D-057 · Splits are weight-adjusted with Concept2's formula

**Decision.** `factor = (bodyweight_lbs / 270) ^ 0.222`, applied to time.

**Why.** The vault states exactly one athletic goal — "sub-2:00 **weight-adjusted** 500m
split" — so a site showing only raw splits could not answer whether he is close to it. At
215 lb the two differ by about seven seconds.

The direction is worth stating because it is the opposite of the intuitive reading: the
adjustment discounts *lighter* athletes, so **putting on mass makes this goal harder**. Both
the raw and the adjusted line are charted for that reason — an adjusted line alone would let
a lighter month read as a faster month. There is a test pinning the direction specifically.

The number the page leads with is the **required raw split**, because "sub-2:00 adjusted" is
not something anyone can pace to on a monitor and "2:06.2" is.

**How to reverse.** Show `splitPer500S` only and drop the Adjusted column.

### D-056 · The protocol is parsed from the vault, not written in code

**Decision.** SPM targets, the rehab protocol, the weekly split and the goal are read from
`context/02_physical_performance/` at request time by `lib/athletics/protocol.ts`.

**Why.** All four already live in the vault. A copy in TypeScript would drift: Victor edits
the markdown, the site keeps showing last month's programme, and nothing says which is right.
Parsing means editing the vault *is* editing the app — no code change, no deploy.

The cost is that reformatting those files can stop a section parsing. Every parser returns
empty rather than throwing, and every panel says "not found in the vault, from this heading"
rather than rendering an empty box — so a parse miss reads as a parse miss. Tests run against
the real vault files, which is what would actually catch a reformat.

Parsing is line-based, not one large regex: the vault is CRLF, `$` under `m` does not match
before a `\r`, and multi-line patterns have already caused silent bugs in this repo.

**How to reverse.** Hard-code the four structures in `protocol.ts` and delete the vault reads.
The panels stop tracking the vault.

### D-055 · The week's plan is compared to logged sessions coarsely, on purpose

**Decision.** `weekReview` reports whether a day has *any* session, never which planned item
was done. Future days are never "missed".

**Why.** Nothing in the data links a logged workout to a line of the programme. Matching on
the title would mark a rest-day walk as "Team Land Practice, complete" — a confident wrong
answer, which is worse here than an honest coarse one. And a review that shows the whole week
red on a Monday morning is the fastest way to make this view ignored.

**How to reverse.** Match `PlannedDay.items` against workout titles and report per item.
Expect false positives.

## 2026-08-21 · V2 scope

### D-054 · Vitest hook timeout raised to 30s

**Decision.** `hookTimeout: 30_000` in `vitest.config.mts`.

**Why.** The first `beforeEach` in each database test file boots PGlite and runs every
migration; three such files run in parallel workers, and under that load the first hook was
measured at ~16s, past vitest's 10s default. It surfaced as three "Hook timed out" failures
that passed on a re-run — the same flakiness D-050 fixed, from a different cause.

Raised rather than masked: the work genuinely takes that long once per file, and every
subsequent hook is a TRUNCATE taking milliseconds. Verified with two consecutive clean runs.

**How to reverse.** Lower it and the suite goes back to failing intermittently on a cold run.

---

### D-053 · The agenda shows the whole feed, unfiltered

**Decision.** `/private/calendar` lists every event in the Google feed. No classification, no
course-code filter.

**Why.** Victor's calendar is one general calendar — 182 events covering classes, practice and
personal life, of which only about 40 carry anything resembling a course code. A regex
deciding what is a "class" would drop a real one the moment it is titled without a code, and a
silently missing class is worse than a cluttered list. Asked, and he chose showing everything.

**How to reverse.** Filter in `Schedule`. If it ever happens, mark rather than hide, so a
misclassification is cosmetic.

---

### D-052 · Canvas import is a button, not a scheduled job

**Decision.** Assignments are pulled into the task table when Victor presses *Import Canvas*.

**Why.** A nightly sync needs a paid tier, which he ruled out. A free-plan cron would also be
the one part of this able to fail silently at 3am with nobody watching — and there is still no
error reporting (finding F6). A button is honest about when the data was last pulled.

The action calls `updateTag("calendar")` before fetching, because otherwise it would re-read
the 15-minute cache and appear to do nothing.

**How to reverse.** Move the body into a route handler and point a cron at it, once something
watches for failures.

---

### D-051 · Calendar comes from private iCal URLs, via ical.js

**Decision.** Both feeds are read from the secret iCal URLs Google Calendar and Canvas publish
(`GOOGLE_CALENDAR_KEY`, `CANVAS_CALENDAR` — Victor's own names, kept rather than renamed to
match the plan). Parsing uses `ical.js`.

**Why.** No OAuth, no consent screen Google must review, no refresh-token rotation, and no
cost — the objection D-034 raised against calendar sync in V1 does not apply to a feed URL.
The URL *is* the credential, so it lives in the environment and never reaches the browser.

`ical.js` rather than something hand-rolled, because the real feed has 37 recurring rules with
`UNTIL`/`BYDAY`, one VTIMEZONE, nested VALARM blocks and 50 all-day entries. A homemade RRULE
expander gets DST wrong, and the symptom is a class that silently stops appearing.

Two details that cost time: `TimezoneService.register` takes `(component, name?)`, not
`(name, component)` — reversed, it type-checks in plain JS and registers nothing, putting
every event seven hours out. And occurrences are capped at 400 per rule, which the real feed
needed: it contains an unbounded monthly recurrence that otherwise expands to 2058.

**Known limitation, not a defect.** As of 2026-08-22 the Canvas feed is empty (211 bytes, zero
events) and Victor's Fall 2026 classes are not yet in Google Calendar — the recurring classes
in the feed are Fall 2025 and have ended. The pipeline is correct and will fill in; the UI says
so rather than looking broken.

**How to reverse.** Unset the variables; every page keeps working without them.

---

### D-050 · One Postgres per test file, truncated between tests

**Decision.** `src/test/pg.ts` builds one PGlite instance per file and `TRUNCATE ... RESTART
IDENTITY CASCADE`s between tests.

**Why.** The first version made a fresh database and re-ran every migration for *each* test.
With three database test files running concurrently it took 88–155s and, once, failed three
tests that passed on a re-run. A suite that is flaky teaches you to ignore red, which is worse
than having no suite. Now **7s**, and deterministic.

The table list is parsed out of the migration SQL rather than hand-written, because a
hand-written list silently stops truncating a table added later.

**How to reverse.** Go back to per-test instances. Do not.

---

### D-049 · Dictation is feature-detected with `useSyncExternalStore`

**Decision.** The dictate button reads support through `useSyncExternalStore` with a server
snapshot of `false`, and renders nothing when the API is absent.

**Why.** Two constraints met at once. `window` does not exist on the server, so detecting
during render would break hydration; setting state in an effect is what the React lint rule
warns about and causes a cascading render. `useSyncExternalStore` is built for exactly this —
external, non-reactive state — and gives a clean server snapshot.

Rendering nothing rather than a disabled button is deliberate: Safari on iOS has no Web Speech
API, and a control that visibly does nothing is worse than no control.

**How to reverse.** Feature-detect however you like, but do not set state in an effect.

---

### D-048 · Log entries are one table with JSONB fields

**Decision.** `log_entries` holds all six categories: a `category`, an `occurredAt`, a `note`,
and per-category fields in `jsonb`. `searchText` is denormalised on write.

**Why.** The alternative was a column per field across every category — mostly nulls, and a
migration every time Victor wants a field changed. D-039 promises that changing fields is
cheap, and a migration per edit is not cheap.

`searchText` is written by `createEntry` rather than by callers, for the same reason
`bumpUpdated` lives in `writeVaultFile`: an entry whose caller forgot would exist but never be
findable again.

Search uses `plainto_tsquery`, not `to_tsquery` — the latter raises a syntax error on a bare
`&`, so a stray character in the search box would 500 the page. A test covers that.

**How to reverse.** Promote hot fields to real columns; the JSONB stays for the rest.

---

### D-047 · Categories are data, and the form is generated from them

**Decision.** `lib/log/categories.ts` declares six categories and their fields. One
`LogForm` renders any of them; the summary line, the search index and the validation all read
the same definitions.

**Why.** Six bespoke forms would be six places to change when Victor edits the fields, and
D-039 committed to that being a one-file edit. Tests assert the structural invariants that
matter — unique field names, options on every select, and **no category longer than eight
fields**, because the constraint from Q16 is that a log must be fillable in fifteen seconds.

Deliberately absent: any mood or energy scale. Victor put that in V3, and a 1–5 filled in from
habit rather than reflection is worse than nothing. A test pins that too.

**How to reverse.** Edit the array. That is the whole point.

---

### D-046 · The freshness walk is memoised at module scope

**Decision.** `loadFreshness` caches the 34-file disk read in a module-level variable.

**Why.** The vault ships inside the serverless bundle, so its contents are fixed for the life
of a deployment — re-reading every file on every request was repeated work with no possible
change to find. Module scope is the right cache: it survives across requests in a warm
function and is discarded automatically when a new deployment starts a new instance, so there
is no invalidation to get wrong. Ages are still computed per call, since those move with the
clock rather than the files.

**How to reverse.** Call `readVaultFiles()` directly; `resetFreshnessCache()` already exists
as the test seam.

---

### D-045 · Loading boundaries and streaming, because the server cannot get faster

**Decision.** A `loading.tsx` under `/private`, and a Suspense boundary around every
database or GitHub read on Today, Work, Academics, Athletics, Calendar and Hobbies.

**Why.** Victor reported it still felt slow after D-042 made the server measurably faster, so
I measured the thing I had not: production. `/signin` — a dynamic page with *no* database and
*no* API call — costs 335–440ms of Vercel function time, against 70ms to connect. That
overhead is not mine to remove, and it is paid on every navigation because every private page
is `force-dynamic`.

The mistake was optimising server time when the problem was that **nothing appeared on screen
while it ran**. With no loading boundary the App Router has nothing to show, so a click left
the old page sitting there and the app read as frozen rather than busy.

Measured after: TTFB 50–110ms across every private page, and the streaming order is verified
in the HTML — the shell and skeleton ship at byte ~6.7k, the content arrives at ~30k.

This also matters most exactly when the app feels worst: Neon's free tier suspends after a
few minutes idle, so the first query after a break is slow. The shell no longer waits for it.

**How to reverse.** Delete `loading.tsx` and unwrap the Suspense boundaries. Do not, unless
the pages stop being `force-dynamic`.

---

### D-044 · The academic tracker's vault implementation is deleted, not kept alongside

**Decision.** `checklist.ts`, its 25 tests, `academic-tracker.tsx`, `tracker.ts`, and the
academics actions are removed. `/private/sprint` and its form go too — goals are edited
inline on Today now.

**Why.** D-037 merged the tracker into the task model. Leaving the vault version in place
would have shipped both, which is the exact failure the merge exists to prevent, and keeping
unused-but-tested modules "in case" is how dead code accumulates. Everything is one `git
show` away if feature 5's rehab checklist wants it back.

**How to reverse.** `git show b069dcb -- web/src/lib/vault/checklist.ts` and friends.

---

### D-043 · Freshness is a badge, not a panel

**Decision.** The dashboard's full-width freshness section is replaced by a chip in the page
header that appears **only when something is stale**, expanding to a list on click.

**Why.** Victor's verdict on V1: it "should be here as an alert that something is not fresh,
almost as a notification. The full bar itself should be removed." The audit is unchanged —
this reverses only the presentation. A permanent list of 34 healthy files is furniture.

**How to reverse.** `freshness-panel.tsx` in git history; the report shape is identical.

---

### D-042 · Vault reads are cached; the write path is not

**Decision.** `readVaultFileCached` wraps reads in `unstable_cache` tagged `vault`, and
`writeVaultFile` calls `updateTag` after committing. Actions keep the uncached reader.

**Why.** Measured: private pages spent 300–800ms on serial GitHub round trips, against 33ms
for the one page making no network call. After caching, best-of-five steady state went
320→69ms (work), 377→32ms (calendar), 761→186ms (academics).

Three specifics worth keeping:
- **`unstable_cache`, not `use cache`.** The directive needs `cacheComponents: true`, which
  changes every dynamic API in the app and conflicts with the `force-dynamic` these pages
  rely on. Deprecated, but the migration is contained to one function.
- **`updateTag`, not `revalidateTag`.** The latter now requires a cache profile, and the
  recommended `"max"` is stale-while-revalidate — which serves the *pre-edit* content on the
  next read, making a save look like it did nothing.
- **The write path must not use the cache.** It needs a live blob SHA; a cached one turns
  last-write-wins into last-write-fails.

**How to reverse.** Call `readVaultFile` directly and delete the tag. Pages get slow again.

---

### D-041 · Every GitHub request has an 8-second deadline

**Decision.** Octokit is constructed with a `fetch` that carries `AbortSignal.timeout`.

**Why.** `fetch` has no default timeout, so a network problem was not a slow page but a hung
one — when the connection dropped mid-session, pages sat for minutes. 5s was the first value
and it fired during ordinary use on a working connection, which is worse than no timeout: it
turns slow into broken. 8s rides out a bad moment and still fails before anyone assumes the
app has died.

**How to reverse.** Remove the custom fetch. Do not, unless something else bounds the wait.

---

### D-040 · The card sweep plays once (reverses half of D-012)

**Decision.** `infinite` becomes `forwards`, and the keyframes drop the 55%-then-hold that
existed only to pause between loops. Duration 0.85s.

**Why.** Victor: "once it does the sweep once it should not repeat it when still hovering."

D-012 said explicitly which half of it must survive a reversal, and that instruction is
followed here: the corrected base transform (resting off-card) and the 260% travel stay,
because those were the bug fix — without them the highlight parks itself over the card and
never exits. Only the looping goes.

**How to reverse.** `forwards` → `infinite` and restore the hold keyframe.

---

### D-039 · Log fields are proposed from the vault, then edited

**Decision.** I draft three or four fields per log category from what the vault already
records — SPM and drag factor for erg work, course and grade for academics — and Victor
strikes out what is wrong.

**Why.** Victor chose this over specifying fields from scratch. Starting from the vault means
the fields match the vocabulary already in use, so a logged erg piece and the PR table talk
about the same quantities.

**How to reverse.** Fields live in one schema module per category; changing them is a
migration, not a rewrite.

---

### D-038 · Voice input is worth building — Android confirmed

**Decision.** Quick-log screens get Web Speech API dictation.

**Why.** I had assumed iPhone and was ready to drop this: Safari on iOS has no Web Speech
API, and the iOS keyboard's own dictation button already covers every text field for free.
Victor logs from Android/Chrome, where the API exists. About an hour of work.

**How to reverse.** Feature-detect and fall back to a plain field — which is also what any
future iPhone would get.

---

### D-037 · Everything actionable is one task model

**Decision.** Sprint goals, the academic tracker, daily to-dos, and Canvas assignments become
rows in one `tasks` table, each with a source and a due date. The homepage filters to today
and this week.

**Why.** V2 was about to ship a fourth place to look for "what should I be doing". Victor
named "too complex to use" as the thing that would make him abandon the project, so four
competing lists is not a style question, it is the failure mode. Nothing is deleted: sprint
goals become tasks tagged as goals, tracker items become tasks with a course.

**Cost.** This partly supersedes D-032, which put tracker items in `current_sprint.md`. Those
rows move to Postgres. The markdown tracker section stays readable but stops being the
editable source.

**How to reverse.** The task source column makes the origin of every row recoverable, so
splitting them back out is a query, not an archaeology exercise.

### D-036 · High-frequency writes go to Postgres, not the vault

**Decision.** Anything logged often — daily entries, tasks, workouts — is written to Postgres
and saved immediately. The vault keeps prose that is written rarely and read by AI agents.

**Why.** Finding F2: every vault write is a commit and a deploy, so ticking three boxes was
three commits, three builds, and a plausible route to Vercel's Hobby ceiling. Victor asked
for immediate saves (Q77) and accepted logs living outside the vault (Q76).

**The tension, stated.** Victor also wants the site to create vault files (Q80), which can
never be instant — a GitHub round trip is 1–2 seconds. Resolution: two visibly different
actions. Logging is silent and instant; writing to the vault shows a publishing state,
because it is editing the permanent record.

**Deferred.** Syncing Postgres logs back into vault summaries is V3 by Victor's own call
(Q76).

**How to reverse.** The vault write path is untouched and still used for prose, so reverting
means pointing the log actions back at it and accepting the commit-per-save cost again.

### D-035 · Checklist editing lives in its own module, not in `frontmatter.ts`

**Decision.** `lib/vault/checklist.ts` holds the `- [ ]` item reader and writers.
`frontmatter.ts` stays about frontmatter and generic section edits.

**Why.** Checklists are one markdown convention, not a property of every vault file. Keeping
them apart means `frontmatter.ts` does not grow a second vocabulary. Both modules repeat the
same two guards on purpose — `\r?\n` for CRLF files, `(?![\s\S])` rather than `$` for
end-of-input — and each has its own tests for them.

**How to reverse.** Merge the file back; nothing else depends on the split.

---

### D-034 · The Calendar page has no calendar

**Decision.** `/private/calendar` states plainly that live sync is out of scope for V1 and
shows the operating rules from the sprint file instead.

**Why.** Google Calendar reads need an OAuth consent screen Google must review before it
works beyond a test account, plus refresh-token storage and rotation. That is days of work
for a read-only view of an app already open in another tab, and it would be the only part of
2ndMind that can lock itself out without warning. A page that says so is more useful than a
page pretending to be finished.

**How to reverse.** V2 candidate. If it happens, an `.ics` subscription URL is a fraction of
the work of OAuth and covers reading.

---

### D-033 · The Work page is not an application tracker

**Decision.** `/private/work` renders pipeline strategy and career targets. It does not log
or count applications.

**Why.** `internship_pipeline.md` records that a background script already scans Gmail and
maintains a master Google Sheet, and explicitly asks AI assistants to leave that data entry
alone. A second tracker would be a competing source of truth for facts the sheet already
owns — the exact failure this vault exists to prevent.

**How to reverse.** If the sheet is ever retired, this is where its replacement goes.

---

### D-032 · The academic tracker edits the sprint file in place

**Decision.** Tracker items are `- [ ]` rows under `## 3. Academic Tracker` in
`current_sprint.md`. Adding, ticking, and removing each commit that one file. Adding reuses a
blank placeholder row before appending.

**Why.** The tracker already existed there as prose. Moving it to Postgres would split "what
am I working on" across two stores; keeping it in markdown means it still reads correctly
with no site at all, which is the property that makes this a vault and not an app.

A test reads the **real** `current_sprint.md` and asserts the section is found and everything
outside it stays byte-identical, so renaming or re-numbering the heading fails loudly in CI
instead of silently doing nothing in the UI.

**How to reverse.** Point the actions at a different file and heading; the pure functions
take both as parameters.

---

### D-031 · Athletics degrades to an explanation when `DATABASE_URL` is absent

**Decision.** `/private/athletics` renders a short "no database connected" page rather than
throwing. `isDatabaseConfigured()` is a separate function from `db()`.

**Why.** The same shape as D-021, applied before it could bite: the page someone opens to
find out why athletics is broken must not be the page that crashes on it. Verified by
loading the route with the variable unset — 200, self-explaining — and again with the
variable set but the tables missing, which renders the migration hint.

**How to reverse.** Delete `isDatabaseConfigured` and let `db()` throw.

---

### D-030 · Estimated 1RM is capped at 12 reps

**Decision.** `estimateOneRepMax` returns null above 12 reps rather than extrapolating.

**Why.** Epley drifts badly at high rep counts. Uncapped, a set of 20 light reps outranks a
genuine heavy single and sits at the top of the strength board forever — a wrong number that
looks plausible, which is the worst kind.

**How to reverse.** Raise or remove `E1RM_REP_CAP` in `lib/athletics/prs.ts`. A different
formula (Brzycki, Lombardi) would be a better fix than a higher cap.

---

### D-029 · Warmup sets are stored but never ranked

**Decision.** Every set from an import is written, including warmups; `isWorkingSet()`
excludes `warmup` and `drop` from records.

**Why.** Throwing them away at import would be lossy and irreversible — session volume and
history would be wrong forever. Counting them toward a PR would be wrong in the other
direction, and a single mistyped warmup would set a permanent fake record.

**How to reverse.** Change `isWorkingSet` to return true. The data is all still there.

---

### D-028 · The database layer is tested against real Postgres, in WASM

**Decision.** `@electric-sql/pglite` (dev dependency) runs the committed migration SQL and
the real queries in the test suite. Query functions take the handle as a parameter so the
same code runs on PGlite and on Neon.

**Why.** A mocked query builder asserts that the code called the mock, which is worth very
little — it would have accepted the numeric-as-string bug in D-027 without complaint. This
costs nothing, needs no server, and runs offline, which matters for the Taiwan trip.

**Cost.** About 17 seconds of the suite, from spinning up a fresh database per test.

**How to reverse.** Drop the dependency and delete `athletics/__tests__/queries.test.ts`.
Keep the parameter-passing shape regardless; it is good design independent of testing.

---

### D-027 · Numeric columns are declared `mode: "number"`

**Decision.** `numeric("weight_lbs", { …, mode: "number" })` on every numeric column.

**Why.** Postgres `numeric` arrives as a *string* by default in node-postgres, to protect
precision. Under string comparison `"95" > "155"` is true, so a warmup would outrank every
working set and every PR would be quietly wrong. A test asserts `typeof` is number and that
the max of a real stored session is 155.

**How to reverse.** Drop the mode and convert at each call site — but then every comparison
becomes a place to forget.

---

### D-026 · Imports are idempotent through a derived `external_id`

**Decision.** Each imported session gets `hevy:<ISO timestamp>:<title-slug>`, uniquely
indexed. Sets are written only for workouts the insert actually created.

**Why.** A Hevy export is cumulative — every export contains the entire history — so the
natural workflow is re-importing a growing file. Without this, the second import doubles
everything, and the damage shows up only as inflated PRs and volume, with no error anywhere.
The second half matters as much as the first: skipping the workout row but still appending
its sets would duplicate the sets against the original session.

Manual entries leave `external_id` null, and Postgres treats nulls as distinct in a unique
index, so hand-logged sessions never collide.

**How to reverse.** Drop the unique index. Do not, unless imports become one-shot.

---

### D-025 · Personal records are computed on read, never stored

**Decision.** No `records` table. `strengthRecords()` and `ergRecords()` run over every
stored set on each page load.

**Why.** A stored record is a cached answer with no invalidation story: correct a mistyped
weight and the PR keeps reading high forever, silently. At this scale — a few thousand sets
— recomputing is free.

**How to reverse.** Add a materialised table if the set count ever makes this slow. It will
not at one athlete's volume.

---

### D-024 · Training data lives in Postgres, not in the markdown vault

**Decision.** Athletics is the one feature backed by a database (Neon free tier).

**Why.** Everything else in 2ndMind is prose that a human writes and reads. Training data is
tabular and queried *across* rows — "best set of Bench Press at five reps" is a group-by. A
Hevy export is thousands of set rows, which no markdown file should hold. The rest of the
site is unaffected and builds without `DATABASE_URL`.

**Privacy.** Health data is the category that must never be public. No public route imports
`lib/db` or `lib/athletics`, and the public build runs with no database configured at all.

**How to reverse.** Nothing else depends on it; delete the routes, the two lib folders, and
the dependency. The vault's `benchmarks_and_logs.md` remains the hand-written record.

---

### D-023 · `outputFileTracingRoot` is what puts the vault in the serverless bundle

**Decision.** `next.config.ts` sets `outputFileTracingRoot` to the repo root and excludes
`context/99_archive/**`. It sets no `outputFileTracingIncludes`.

**Why.** Measured rather than assumed, because the first version of this config was wrong in
two ways. With no config, **zero** vault markdown files are traced into `/private` — the
freshness widget would have thrown ENOENT in production while working perfectly locally.
Widening the root alone fixes it: Next's analysis of the `readdirSync` in `vault/load.ts`
then pulls the tree in by itself, making the `includes` entries redundant. And an explicit
`include` *beats* an `exclude`, so adding one made the 10 archive files impossible to leave
behind — the build kept shipping superseded resumes and transcripts into the function.

**How to reverse.** Remove both keys and the freshness panel loses its data source in
production only, which is the hardest kind of regression to notice. Verify any change by
reading `.next/server/app/private/page.js.nft.json` and counting traced `.md` files: 34 is
correct, 44 means the archive came along, 0 means it is broken.

---

### D-022 · The freshness audit reads the filesystem, narrowing D-019

**Decision.** `loadFreshness()` walks `context/` on disk. D-019's rule — private pages read
the vault over the GitHub API — still holds for every *editable* file.

**Why.** Freshness inspects 34 files to read one frontmatter field from each. Over the API
that is 34 round trips per dashboard render, against a rate limit, to compute something that
changes once a day.

**Cost, stated plainly.** After a write through the site, the panel shows the pre-edit date
until Vercel redeploys. That self-corrects in a couple of minutes, because a vault write is
a commit and a commit triggers a deploy — but it is a real window where the dashboard and
the vault disagree.

**How to reverse.** Swap `readVaultFiles()` for API reads, and add caching, or the dashboard
becomes unusably slow.

---

### D-020 · Vault writes validate the path before anything else

**Decision.** `assertVaultPath` rejects traversal, backslashes, non-`context/` prefixes, and
non-`.md` files — in that order.

**Why.** A fine-grained PAT with "Contents: read and write" covers **every file in the repo**,
not just the vault. That includes `web/` and `.github/workflows/`. Path validation is the only
thing between a bug in a form handler and an arbitrary repo write, including a workflow file
that would then run with the repo's own permissions. Shape is checked before prefix so a
backslash path reports as traversal rather than as "outside the vault", which would point at
the wrong defect.

**How to reverse.** Don't.

### D-021 · A misconfigured deployment explains itself instead of crashing

**Decision.** `isAuthConfigured()` is separate from `getSession()`, and `/signin` renders a
"Not configured" notice rather than throwing.

**Why.** Found by probing the live deploy: with `SESSION_SECRET` unset, `/signin` returned
**500**. The sign-in page is exactly where someone looks when auth is broken, so it was the
one page that must not be the page that crashes. `/private` was already failing closed
correctly; only the explanation was missing.

**How to reverse.** Don't — but note the rule it encodes: auth failures fail closed, and
configuration failures stay legible.

### D-019 · Private pages read the vault over the API, not the filesystem

**Decision.** `/private/*` fetches vault files through the GitHub Contents API even though
the repo is checked out beside the app.

**Why.** Two reasons. Vercel's runtime filesystem contains only what the build traced, and
dynamically-constructed paths are not traced — so `fs.readFileSync` would work locally and
404 in production. And after a write, the local copy is stale by definition; the API is the
thing that just changed.

**Cost.** Every private page load is a network round trip. Acceptable for one user; if it
ever isn't, cache per-request rather than reverting to the filesystem.

### D-018 · Passkey auth with no database

**Decision.** The enrolled credential lives in two environment variables
(`PASSKEY_CREDENTIAL_ID`, `PASSKEY_PUBLIC_KEY`). Sessions are HMAC-signed cookies built on
Web Crypto. There is no user table and no auth vendor.

**Why.** Following D-006 (Clerk gates passkeys behind $20-25/mo). With exactly one user, the
stored values are not secret — the private key never leaves the authenticator — so a database
buys nothing here. Web Crypto rather than a JWT library because `proxy.ts` may run on an edge
runtime with no Node `crypto`, and an HMAC over JSON is the whole requirement.

**What this design gives up.** Signature counters, which detect a cloned authenticator, need
somewhere to persist. Platform passkeys (Touch ID, Windows Hello) report counter 0 and never
increment, so there is nothing to compare — which is the only reason this works. **A hardware
key that does increment would need real storage.** Rotating or adding a device means
re-running enrolment and pasting new values into Vercel.

**Enrolment is closed by default.** `PASSKEY_REGISTRATION_SECRET` must be both set and
supplied. An open registration endpoint on a deployment with no credential configured would
hand the private site to whoever found it first.

**Enrolment is a page, not a script.** `/signin/register` runs the ceremony through
`@simplewebauthn/browser`. The first draft of this was a console snippet in a markdown file;
that was fragile enough to be a bad answer, and hand-rolling base64url in a copy-pasted
script is exactly where this goes wrong silently. The page 404s when the gate is shut.

**No recovery flow, deliberately.** Lose the device and you re-open the gate and re-enrol.
Since Victor controls the environment variables, that path is always available to him and to
nobody else — which is a better property than any recovery mechanism a single-user app could
offer. Written up in `REGISTER_PASSKEY.md`.

**How to reverse.** Move the credential into Neon (`DATABASE_URL` already exists for
athletics) and store the counter alongside it. The ceremony code does not change.

### D-017 · The resume is generated from the vault, in two languages

**Decision.** `/resume/[variant]` renders from `web/src/lib/resume.ts`; `99_archive/resume.md`
is written by `scripts/build_indexes.py`. Both select entries by each entry's own
`resume_variants` field. A test asserts the two agree.

**Why.** Victor asked for a genuinely generated resume, not a maintained document — bullets
already live in canonical entries and a hand-written copy guarantees drift. The vault must
also stay readable without running the web app, which is why the Python copy exists at all.
The duplication is the cost of that, and the drift test is what makes it safe.

**How to reverse.** Delete `build_resume` from `build_indexes.py` and the
"archived copy agrees with the site" describe block. The site is unaffected.

### D-016 · Print styling, not a PDF library

**Decision.** The PDF comes from the browser's own print dialog, driven by an `@media print`
block. No PDF generation dependency.

**Why.** $0 budget, and browser "Save as PDF" produces **selectable text** — which is what
resume parsers read. A rasterised dark-theme screenshot would be unparseable by the ATS
systems these applications go through. Victor also said he would export the PDF manually.

**Consequences worth knowing.** Everything themed is forced to near-black; muted greys that
read well on `#0a161b` print as illegible haze, so they are darkened to `#333`. Links print
without underlines because the URLs are already spelled out in the contact line.
`.resume-block` sets `break-inside: avoid` so a bullet list is never orphaned from its job
title across a page boundary.

**How to reverse.** Delete the `@media print` block in `globals.css`.

### D-015 · RLC lab dropped from the robotics resume variant

**Decision.** `labs/rlc.md` had `resume_variants: [robotics]`; now `[]`.

**Why.** Consistency with D-014. Having argued that assigned coursework is padding on the
portfolio, leaving it on the resume would be incoherent — and the solenoid project already
covers ESP32 instrumentation, better and with a self-directed result.

**How to reverse.** Put `robotics` back in that file's `resume_variants` and rerun
`python scripts/build_indexes.py`.

### D-014 · Labs cut to one entry, promoted to a project

**Decision.** Four of the five Physics 4BL labs (optics, RLC, sound, resistor/LED) are now
`public: false`. The solenoid bit reader moved to `01_engineering/projects/` as a hardware
project. The `/labs` route and its nav entry are gone.

**Why.** Victor's read was right. Those four are *assigned coursework* — every student in the
course measures an I-V curve and the speed of sound. They demonstrate compliance, not
capability, and on a portfolio they dilute the work that does differentiate. The solenoid lab
is categorically different: a self-directed macro-scale hard-disk-reader analog, 387-turn
coil, op-amp gain staging, calibration matrix, 100% decode accuracy. That is a build, and it
belongs next to the other builds rather than filed under coursework.

A `/labs` index holding one item also reads as an abandoned section, which is worse than no
section.

**How to reverse.** Flip `public: true` on the four lab files, restore `web/src/app/labs/`
from git history (`git show 2699a2a:web/src/app/labs/page.tsx`), and re-add the nav entry in
`site-header.tsx`. The lab entries were never deleted from the vault, so nothing is lost.

**Note.** The four labs stay in the vault deliberately — they are real academic history and
useful context for any AI reading the vault. Only their *publication* changed.

### D-013 · Projects carry a hero image, with a generated placeholder fallback

**Decision.** `image` is an optional project frontmatter field. When absent, `ProjectFigure`
renders a deterministic SVG placeholder derived from the project slug rather than a grey box.

**Why.** Victor has no photography yet but will. A placeholder that is on-palette and varies
per project keeps the grid looking designed in the meantime, and dropping a real file in later
is a one-line frontmatter change with no component edit.

**How to reverse.** Delete the `image` field and render nothing; the grid falls back to the
text-only cards from commit `2699a2a`.

### D-012 · The card sweep loops while hovered

**Decision.** `card-scan`'s highlight sweep repeats on a 2.4s cycle (sweep, then pause)
instead of firing once.

**Why.** Two reasons, one of them a bug fix. The one-shot version ended with the highlight
*parked over the card*: the animation had no fill mode, so on completion the transform
reverted to its base value and left a bright static band sitting on the left of every hovered
card. The keyframes also only travelled to 120% of the bar's own width — about 54% of the
card — so it never actually exited. Base transform now rests off-card and the travel is
260%. Looping is also the thematically right behaviour: a scope refreshes continuously.

**How to reverse.** Drop `infinite` from the animation shorthand in `globals.css` and keep
the corrected keyframes and base transform — those are the bug fix and should not be reverted
independently.

## 2026-08-20

### D-011 · Breadth content is its own vault entity, not a projection of the training logs

**Decision.** `context/03_craft_and_creative/pursuits/` holds the portfolio framing of dragon
boat, fabrication, and baking. The public build never reads `benchmarks_and_logs.md` or
`culinary_formulas.md`.

**Why.** Those files hold bodyweight, protein and creatine targets, and a lower-back rehab
protocol. Victor is comfortable storing health data in the cloud; that is not the same as
publishing it to recruiters. A separate entity means the risk is structurally absent rather
than mitigated by an allowlist that someone has to maintain correctly forever.

**How to reverse.** Not recommended. If the breadth section is cut entirely, delete the
`pursuits/` directory, `pursuitSchema`, `loadPursuits`, `publicPursuits`, and the section in
`page.tsx`.

### D-010 · Collaborator names are never published; group size is

**Decision.** `collaborators` is excluded from the public lab projection. The site shows
"N-person group lab" instead.

**Why.** Victor asked for the names to come off. Beyond that, they are private individuals
who did not agree to appear on a public portfolio. Group size stays because silently
presenting group work as solo misrepresents it to exactly the audience the site is for.

**How to reverse.** Add `collaborators` back to `PublicLab`, `toPublicLab`, and
`PUBLIC_LAB_KEYS`, and delete the privacy test in `public.test.ts`. The names were never
removed from frontmatter.

### D-009 · `## Notes` sections are stripped from every public body

**Decision.** `stripInternalSections()` removes the vault's `## Notes` convention from
project, experience, and lab bodies before rendering.

**Why.** Those sections hold relative links into `99_archive` and notes-to-self about
frontmatter. Bodies render verbatim on public pages, so they were being published. Handling
it at the projection layer rather than per-file means the next entry added is covered without
anyone remembering to.

**How to reverse.** Delete the call sites; the function is pure and independently tested.

### D-008 · Palette replaced with Victor's six swatches

**Decision.** Gold/warm-near-black is gone. Teal `#09A1A1` primary, rose `#D396A6`
secondary, peach `#F6C992` as the single warm note, on grounds derived from `#30525C`.

**Why.** Victor supplied the palette and said the gold and the flat background were not to
taste. Only `#30525C` was dark enough to build grounds from, so the page and card colours are
that hue driven down in lightness — this keeps surfaces the same temperature as the accents
instead of fighting them.

**Resolved 2026-08-21.** The supplied image labelled a *pink* swatch `#30525C`, which is a
dark slate teal, so the hex codes were treated as authoritative over the swatch colours.
Victor confirmed the result: "I like the current palette, keep using what is currently
there." The palette is settled — do not reopen it without being asked.

**How to reverse.** `git show a81dee8:web/src/app/globals.css` has the gold palette intact.

### D-007 · The background is not a flat fill

**Decision.** `<html>` paints the base colour; `body::before` layers three drifting radial
pools and `body::after` adds SVG-noise grain.

**Why.** Victor asked for the solid background to go. The grain is not decoration — wide
radial fills band visibly on 8-bit displays, and noise dithers them out.

**Constraint this creates.** `body` must stay background-less. Giving it an opaque background
buries both layers, and the symptom (a flat page) looks like the CSS simply did not apply.

**How to reverse.** Delete the two pseudo-element rules and put `bg-background` back on
`body` in `layout.tsx`.

### D-006 · Auth is self-hosted WebAuthn, not Clerk

**Decision.** `@clerk/nextjs` removed; `@simplewebauthn/server` + `/browser` in.

**Why.** Clerk gates passkeys to its Pro tier at $20-25/mo — recurring, and far outside the
$0 (max $5) budget. There is exactly one user forever, which makes Clerk's real job
(multi-tenant identity, org management, arbitrary sign-up flows) pure overhead.

**How to reverse.** Reinstall `@clerk/nextjs` and accept the subscription, or use Clerk's
free-tier email-code sign-in and give up passkeys.

### D-005 · Motion lives in two custom utilities, not repeated class chains

**Decision.** `card-scan` and `link-wipe` are `@utility` blocks in `globals.css`.

**Why.** The same hover treatment appears on five surfaces. As a Tailwind chain it was ~90
characters repeated per element, and changing the feel meant editing every one. Both collapse
under `prefers-reduced-motion` in one place.

**How to reverse.** Inline the CSS at each call site.

### D-004 · `SiteHeader` is a Client Component

**Decision.** It uses `usePathname` for the active-route indicator.

**Why.** The alternative is threading the pathname from every page. It receives only a name
string, so the RSC payload cost is negligible.

**How to reverse.** Drop the indicator and the `"use client"` directive.

### D-003 · Public projections name every field explicitly

Never spread-and-delete. A field added to the vault tomorrow is private by default, and
reaching a public page requires a deliberate edit plus a test update. **Do not "simplify"
this into a spread.** Two real leaks were caught by scanning built output, not by the type
system.

### D-002 · Fonts are self-hosted

`next/font/google` fetches at build time; a meaningful chunk of this project is written in a
car and on a plane. Files came from `@fontsource`.

### D-001 · Monorepo — `web/` inside the vault repo

Vault writes trigger public rebuilds, and other projects can clone and read `context/`
directly, which Victor asked for.
