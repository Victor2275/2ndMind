# Decision Log

Every non-obvious choice, why it was made, and **how to undo it**. Victor reviews the site
and reverses things; this file exists so reversing is a lookup, not an archaeology dig.

Newest first. When a decision is reversed, do not delete the entry — move it to
[Reversed](#reversed) with a note. The history of what was tried and rejected is the
useful part.

### D-020 · Vault writes validate the path before anything else

**Decision.** `assertVaultPath` rejects traversal, backslashes, non-`context/` prefixes, and
non-`.md` files — in that order.

**Why.** A fine-grained PAT with "Contents: read and write" covers **every file in the repo**,
not just the vault. That includes `web/` and `.github/workflows/`. Path validation is the only
thing between a bug in a form handler and an arbitrary repo write, including a workflow file
that would then run with the repo's own permissions. Shape is checked before prefix so a
backslash path reports as traversal rather than as "outside the vault", which would point at
the wrong defect.

**How to reverse.** Don't.

### D-021 · A misconfigured deployment explains itself instead of crashing

**Decision.** `isAuthConfigured()` is separate from `getSession()`, and `/signin` renders a
"Not configured" notice rather than throwing.

**Why.** Found by probing the live deploy: with `SESSION_SECRET` unset, `/signin` returned
**500**. The sign-in page is exactly where someone looks when auth is broken, so it was the
one page that must not be the page that crashes. `/private` was already failing closed
correctly; only the explanation was missing.

**How to reverse.** Don't — but note the rule it encodes: auth failures fail closed, and
configuration failures stay legible.

### D-019 · Private pages read the vault over the API, not the filesystem

**Decision.** `/private/*` fetches vault files through the GitHub Contents API even though
the repo is checked out beside the app.

**Why.** Two reasons. Vercel's runtime filesystem contains only what the build traced, and
dynamically-constructed paths are not traced — so `fs.readFileSync` would work locally and
404 in production. And after a write, the local copy is stale by definition; the API is the
thing that just changed.

**Cost.** Every private page load is a network round trip. Acceptable for one user; if it
ever isn't, cache per-request rather than reverting to the filesystem.

### D-018 · Passkey auth with no database

**Decision.** The enrolled credential lives in two environment variables
(`PASSKEY_CREDENTIAL_ID`, `PASSKEY_PUBLIC_KEY`). Sessions are HMAC-signed cookies built on
Web Crypto. There is no user table and no auth vendor.

**Why.** Following D-006 (Clerk gates passkeys behind $20-25/mo). With exactly one user, the
stored values are not secret — the private key never leaves the authenticator — so a database
buys nothing here. Web Crypto rather than a JWT library because `proxy.ts` may run on an edge
runtime with no Node `crypto`, and an HMAC over JSON is the whole requirement.

**What this design gives up.** Signature counters, which detect a cloned authenticator, need
somewhere to persist. Platform passkeys (Touch ID, Windows Hello) report counter 0 and never
increment, so there is nothing to compare — which is the only reason this works. **A hardware
key that does increment would need real storage.** Rotating or adding a device means
re-running enrolment and pasting new values into Vercel.

**Enrolment is closed by default.** `PASSKEY_REGISTRATION_SECRET` must be both set and
supplied. An open registration endpoint on a deployment with no credential configured would
hand the private site to whoever found it first.

**Enrolment is a page, not a script.** `/signin/register` runs the ceremony through
`@simplewebauthn/browser`. The first draft of this was a console snippet in a markdown file;
that was fragile enough to be a bad answer, and hand-rolling base64url in a copy-pasted
script is exactly where this goes wrong silently. The page 404s when the gate is shut.

**No recovery flow, deliberately.** Lose the device and you re-open the gate and re-enrol.
Since Victor controls the environment variables, that path is always available to him and to
nobody else — which is a better property than any recovery mechanism a single-user app could
offer. Written up in `REGISTER_PASSKEY.md`.

**How to reverse.** Move the credential into Neon (`DATABASE_URL` already exists for
athletics) and store the counter alongside it. The ceremony code does not change.

### D-017 · The resume is generated from the vault, in two languages

**Decision.** `/resume/[variant]` renders from `web/src/lib/resume.ts`; `99_archive/resume.md`
is written by `scripts/build_indexes.py`. Both select entries by each entry's own
`resume_variants` field. A test asserts the two agree.

**Why.** Victor asked for a genuinely generated resume, not a maintained document — bullets
already live in canonical entries and a hand-written copy guarantees drift. The vault must
also stay readable without running the web app, which is why the Python copy exists at all.
The duplication is the cost of that, and the drift test is what makes it safe.

**How to reverse.** Delete `build_resume` from `build_indexes.py` and the
"archived copy agrees with the site" describe block. The site is unaffected.

### D-016 · Print styling, not a PDF library

**Decision.** The PDF comes from the browser's own print dialog, driven by an `@media print`
block. No PDF generation dependency.

**Why.** $0 budget, and browser "Save as PDF" produces **selectable text** — which is what
resume parsers read. A rasterised dark-theme screenshot would be unparseable by the ATS
systems these applications go through. Victor also said he would export the PDF manually.

**Consequences worth knowing.** Everything themed is forced to near-black; muted greys that
read well on `#0a161b` print as illegible haze, so they are darkened to `#333`. Links print
without underlines because the URLs are already spelled out in the contact line.
`.resume-block` sets `break-inside: avoid` so a bullet list is never orphaned from its job
title across a page boundary.

**How to reverse.** Delete the `@media print` block in `globals.css`.

### D-015 · RLC lab dropped from the robotics resume variant

**Decision.** `labs/rlc.md` had `resume_variants: [robotics]`; now `[]`.

**Why.** Consistency with D-014. Having argued that assigned coursework is padding on the
portfolio, leaving it on the resume would be incoherent — and the solenoid project already
covers ESP32 instrumentation, better and with a self-directed result.

**How to reverse.** Put `robotics` back in that file's `resume_variants` and rerun
`python scripts/build_indexes.py`.

### D-014 · Labs cut to one entry, promoted to a project

**Decision.** Four of the five Physics 4BL labs (optics, RLC, sound, resistor/LED) are now
`public: false`. The solenoid bit reader moved to `01_engineering/projects/` as a hardware
project. The `/labs` route and its nav entry are gone.

**Why.** Victor's read was right. Those four are *assigned coursework* — every student in the
course measures an I-V curve and the speed of sound. They demonstrate compliance, not
capability, and on a portfolio they dilute the work that does differentiate. The solenoid lab
is categorically different: a self-directed macro-scale hard-disk-reader analog, 387-turn
coil, op-amp gain staging, calibration matrix, 100% decode accuracy. That is a build, and it
belongs next to the other builds rather than filed under coursework.

A `/labs` index holding one item also reads as an abandoned section, which is worse than no
section.

**How to reverse.** Flip `public: true` on the four lab files, restore `web/src/app/labs/`
from git history (`git show 2699a2a:web/src/app/labs/page.tsx`), and re-add the nav entry in
`site-header.tsx`. The lab entries were never deleted from the vault, so nothing is lost.

**Note.** The four labs stay in the vault deliberately — they are real academic history and
useful context for any AI reading the vault. Only their *publication* changed.

### D-013 · Projects carry a hero image, with a generated placeholder fallback

**Decision.** `image` is an optional project frontmatter field. When absent, `ProjectFigure`
renders a deterministic SVG placeholder derived from the project slug rather than a grey box.

**Why.** Victor has no photography yet but will. A placeholder that is on-palette and varies
per project keeps the grid looking designed in the meantime, and dropping a real file in later
is a one-line frontmatter change with no component edit.

**How to reverse.** Delete the `image` field and render nothing; the grid falls back to the
text-only cards from commit `2699a2a`.

### D-012 · The card sweep loops while hovered

**Decision.** `card-scan`'s highlight sweep repeats on a 2.4s cycle (sweep, then pause)
instead of firing once.

**Why.** Two reasons, one of them a bug fix. The one-shot version ended with the highlight
*parked over the card*: the animation had no fill mode, so on completion the transform
reverted to its base value and left a bright static band sitting on the left of every hovered
card. The keyframes also only travelled to 120% of the bar's own width — about 54% of the
card — so it never actually exited. Base transform now rests off-card and the travel is
260%. Looping is also the thematically right behaviour: a scope refreshes continuously.

**How to reverse.** Drop `infinite` from the animation shorthand in `globals.css` and keep
the corrected keyframes and base transform — those are the bug fix and should not be reverted
independently.

### D-011 · Breadth content is its own vault entity, not a projection of the training logs

**Decision.** `context/03_craft_and_creative/pursuits/` holds the portfolio framing of dragon
boat, fabrication, and baking. The public build never reads `benchmarks_and_logs.md` or
`culinary_formulas.md`.

**Why.** Those files hold bodyweight, protein and creatine targets, and a lower-back rehab
protocol. Victor is comfortable storing health data in the cloud; that is not the same as
publishing it to recruiters. A separate entity means the risk is structurally absent rather
than mitigated by an allowlist that someone has to maintain correctly forever.

**How to reverse.** Not recommended. If the breadth section is cut entirely, delete the
`pursuits/` directory, `pursuitSchema`, `loadPursuits`, `publicPursuits`, and the section in
`page.tsx`.

### D-010 · Collaborator names are never published; group size is

**Decision.** `collaborators` is excluded from the public lab projection. The site shows
"N-person group lab" instead.

**Why.** Victor asked for the names to come off. Beyond that, they are private individuals
who did not agree to appear on a public portfolio. Group size stays because silently
presenting group work as solo misrepresents it to exactly the audience the site is for.

**How to reverse.** Add `collaborators` back to `PublicLab`, `toPublicLab`, and
`PUBLIC_LAB_KEYS`, and delete the privacy test in `public.test.ts`. The names were never
removed from frontmatter.

### D-009 · `## Notes` sections are stripped from every public body

**Decision.** `stripInternalSections()` removes the vault's `## Notes` convention from
project, experience, and lab bodies before rendering.

**Why.** Those sections hold relative links into `99_archive` and notes-to-self about
frontmatter. Bodies render verbatim on public pages, so they were being published. Handling
it at the projection layer rather than per-file means the next entry added is covered without
anyone remembering to.

**How to reverse.** Delete the call sites; the function is pure and independently tested.

### D-008 · Palette replaced with Victor's six swatches

**Decision.** Gold/warm-near-black is gone. Teal `#09A1A1` primary, rose `#D396A6`
secondary, peach `#F6C992` as the single warm note, on grounds derived from `#30525C`.

**Why.** Victor supplied the palette and said the gold and the flat background were not to
taste. Only `#30525C` was dark enough to build grounds from, so the page and card colours are
that hue driven down in lightness — this keeps surfaces the same temperature as the accents
instead of fighting them.

**Resolved 2026-08-21.** The supplied image labelled a *pink* swatch `#30525C`, which is a
dark slate teal, so the hex codes were treated as authoritative over the swatch colours.
Victor confirmed the result: "I like the current palette, keep using what is currently
there." The palette is settled — do not reopen it without being asked.

**How to reverse.** `git show a81dee8:web/src/app/globals.css` has the gold palette intact.

### D-007 · The background is not a flat fill

**Decision.** `<html>` paints the base colour; `body::before` layers three drifting radial
pools and `body::after` adds SVG-noise grain.

**Why.** Victor asked for the solid background to go. The grain is not decoration — wide
radial fills band visibly on 8-bit displays, and noise dithers them out.

**Constraint this creates.** `body` must stay background-less. Giving it an opaque background
buries both layers, and the symptom (a flat page) looks like the CSS simply did not apply.

**How to reverse.** Delete the two pseudo-element rules and put `bg-background` back on
`body` in `layout.tsx`.

### D-006 · Auth is self-hosted WebAuthn, not Clerk

**Decision.** `@clerk/nextjs` removed; `@simplewebauthn/server` + `/browser` in.

**Why.** Clerk gates passkeys to its Pro tier at $20-25/mo — recurring, and far outside the
$0 (max $5) budget. There is exactly one user forever, which makes Clerk's real job
(multi-tenant identity, org management, arbitrary sign-up flows) pure overhead.

**How to reverse.** Reinstall `@clerk/nextjs` and accept the subscription, or use Clerk's
free-tier email-code sign-in and give up passkeys.

### D-005 · Motion lives in two custom utilities, not repeated class chains

**Decision.** `card-scan` and `link-wipe` are `@utility` blocks in `globals.css`.

**Why.** The same hover treatment appears on five surfaces. As a Tailwind chain it was ~90
characters repeated per element, and changing the feel meant editing every one. Both collapse
under `prefers-reduced-motion` in one place.

**How to reverse.** Inline the CSS at each call site.

### D-004 · `SiteHeader` is a Client Component

**Decision.** It uses `usePathname` for the active-route indicator.

**Why.** The alternative is threading the pathname from every page. It receives only a name
string, so the RSC payload cost is negligible.

**How to reverse.** Drop the indicator and the `"use client"` directive.

### D-003 · Public projections name every field explicitly

Never spread-and-delete. A field added to the vault tomorrow is private by default, and
reaching a public page requires a deliberate edit plus a test update. **Do not "simplify"
this into a spread.** Two real leaks were caught by scanning built output, not by the type
system.

### D-002 · Fonts are self-hosted

`next/font/google` fetches at build time; a meaningful chunk of this project is written in a
car and on a plane. Files came from `@fontsource`.

### D-001 · Monorepo — `web/` inside the vault repo

Vault writes trigger public rebuilds, and other projects can clone and read `context/`
directly, which Victor asked for.
